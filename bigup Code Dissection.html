<p>The Big Up is a 2D brawler/defense game created in Unity/C# by a team of 4, including myself as the only programmer, though I did also create animations, a small amount of the art and also contributed a fair amount to the game's design, including the initial idea an several of the major mechanics.</p>
<p>Unity wasn't exactly my strong suit going into the project -- it took me the better part of a week to discover the SerializeField attribute. However, I learned as I worked and the game went on to recieve --insert feedback here -- and I came out of the project much richer in terms of Unity skills; not just with scripting but the animator, the powerful prefab system and even experimental systems like the skinning editor in the experimental 2D skeletal animation packages. </p>

<p>Here's a very short script I created for the game which has been heavily commented so that you can see the thought processes behind the implementation:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">

public class SkyScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    //initializing these to our default, 
	//just in case they're not set in the editor
    [SerializeField]
    float startYPos = -90;
    [SerializeField]
    float endYPos = 99;

    private Vector3 pos1;
    private Vector3 pos2;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        //setting up two positions for the texture to move between
		//since it's only moving on the Y axis I'm setting the X and Z values to
        //what they already are, ensuring they won't be affected
        pos1 = new Vector3(transform.position.x, startYPos, transform.position.z);
        pos2 = new Vector3(transform.position.x, endYPos, transform.position.z);

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        //Night doesn't last a determinate amount of time
		//so only move the texture during the day
        if (!MainGameScript.isNight)
        {
            //Lerp (linearly interpolate) between our two positions
			//using a percentage of the day's progress as a weight, meaning
            //this will automatically adjust to changes in the day's length.
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(pos1, pos2, MainGameScript.DayProgress());
        }

        else
        {
            //the bottom of the texture is identical to the top so 
			//this may seem simple but it creates a smooth transition
            transform.position = pos2;
        }
            
    }
}
