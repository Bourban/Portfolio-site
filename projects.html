<h1>Projects</h1>

  <ul>
	
	<li><a href="bigup.html">The Big Up</a>, a 2D defense game created by a small group of postgrad students. As the only programmer I wrote the entire codebase. Also, due to the small size of the team I also contributed significantly to the game's design and created several of the player's animations.</li>

	<li><a href="SFML-Game-Engine-dissection.html">Untitled SFML Games:</a> My ongoing C++ SFML engine development, which can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">GitHub.</a> The latest implementation features jumping physics, collisions, fully animated characters and character swappping for the player. In particular I'd like to highlight the implementation of the <a target="_blank" href=" https://github.com/Bourban/SideScroller/blob/master/Commands.h">Command pattern</a>, which encapsulates user input and allows for easy character swapping.</li>

	<li><a href="https://github.com/Bourban/Snek">Snek</a>, a console-based Snake remake in plain ol' C++ to practice some optimisation techniques with std::vectors, particularly pre-allocating the required memory for adding as many elements as necessary and using emplace_back() rather than push_back() to avoid having to construct a temporary object every time an element is added.</li>

	<li>Some other assorted projects not mentioned here, including my <a href="https://screeps.com/">Screeps</a> AI and some (fairly old) Unity games, can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">GitHub</a> -- so feel free to have a peek.</li>
