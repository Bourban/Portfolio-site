<p>The Big Up is a 2D brawler/defense game created in Unity/C# by a team of 4, including myself as the only programmer, though I did also create animations, a small amount of the art and also contributed a fair amount to the game's design, including the initial idea an several of the major mechanics.</p>

<p>Unity wasn't exactly my strong suit going into the project -- it took me the better part of a week to discover the SerializeField attribute. Not only that but I had never made a game with even basic melee combat, never mind a brawler. However, I learned as I went on and the game went on to recieve --insert feedback here -- and I came out of the project much richer in terms of Unity skills; not just with scripting but the animator, the powerful prefab system and even experimental systems like the skinning editor in the experimental 2D skeletal animation packages. </p>

<p>Here's a very short script I created for the game which has been heavily commented so that you can see the thought processes behind the implementation:</p>

<p>Some other scripts I wrote for the game include a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">Scrolling skybox</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">a randomized wave spawner</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">Power system</a></p>
