  <h1>Jordan Walsh - Bourban.co.uk</h1>
  <p>Hello there! I'm Jordan Walsh; game programmer proficient in C++/C# with a wide range of experience from Gameplay programming in Unity to 2D engine creation with multimedia libraries like SFML. I also occasionally act as a designer, animator and tech support for fellow team members.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If you're stumbled across this site you're likely interested in some of my work:</p>
  <ul>
	
	<li><a href="bigup.html">The Big Up</a>, a 2D defense game created by a small group of postgrad students. As the only programmer I wrote the entire codebase. Also, due to the small size of the team I also contributed significantly to the game's design and created several of the player's animations.</li>

	<li><strong>Untitled SFML Engine:</strong> My ongoing C++ SFML engine development, which can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">GitHub.</a> The latest implementation features jumping physics, collisions, fully animated characters and character swappping for the player. In particular I'd like to highlight the implementation of the <a target="_blank" href=" https://github.com/Bourban/SideScroller/blob/master/Commands.h">Command pattern</a>, which encapsulates user input and allows for easy character swapping.</li>

	<li><a href="https://github.com/Bourban/Snek">Snek</a>, a console-based Snake remake in C++, just made for fun. My other occasional short projects, most of which are open source, can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">GitHub</a> -- so feel free to have a peek.</li>

  <p>Why Bourban? Is it 'cause I like biscuits and whiskey but can't spell? No, it's just because it rhymes with Jordan and my high school friends weren't very creative.</p>
