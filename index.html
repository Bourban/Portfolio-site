  <h1>Bourban.co.uk</h1>
  <p>Hello there! I'm Jordan Walsh; game programmer, designer and (occasionally) tech support for fellow team members. If you've stumbled across this site you're likely interested in some of my work:</p>
  <ul>
	<li><a href="bigup.html">The Big Up</a>, a 2D defense game created by a small group of postgrad students which included myself and one other programmer. In addition to my contribution to the codebase I also created and maintained the programming task list as well as trying to keep us as organised as possible.</li>
	<li>My ongoing C++ SFML solo projects, which can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bourban/">GitHub.</a> In particular I'd like to highlight the implementation of the <a target="_blank" href=" https://github.com/Bourban/SideScroller/blob/master/Commands.h">Command pattern</a>, which encapsulates user input and allows for easy character swapping.</li>
	<li>My occasional short projects, like <a href="https://github.com/Bourban/Snek">Snek</a>, a console-based Snake remake in C++. Most of my short projects are open source, so feel free to have a peek.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you'd like to contact me feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:jordan@bourban.co.uk">email</a>, tweet me at <a  target="_blank" href=https://twitter.com/BourbanMola>@BourbanMola</a> or connect with me on <a target="_blank" href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/bourban/>LinkedIn</a>.</p>
  <p>--- </p>
  <p>Why Bourban? Is it 'cause I like biscuits and whiskey but can't spell? No, it's just because it rhymes with Jordan and my high school mates weren't very creative.</p>
